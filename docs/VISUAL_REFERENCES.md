## Visual Motifs to Carry Into Assets

- **Chromolithograph poster feel**: saturated inks, halftone dots, bold outlines, limited palette (crimson, mustard, indigo, sepia).
- **Spectacle / parade**: wagons, banners, train arrivals, and procession framing.
- **Menagerie / cages**: bars, animal silhouettes, and cage-like lattice patterns.
- **Big‑top textiles**: stitched canvas, rope seams, patchwork panels, faded stripes.
- **Backstage grit**: rigging, pulley marks, grease, ticket litter, confetti fragments.
- **Grotesque sideshow**: exaggerated proportions and caricatured performers in paper‑mâché cutouts.

These motifs are reflected in the asset generation prompts inside `script/generate-assets.ts`.
