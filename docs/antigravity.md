I propose the following changes:\n\n1. Add a seed input field (`<input data-testid=\"input-seed\" placeholder=\"Enter Seed Words...\" />`) with appropriate state handling.\n2. Add a randomize button (`<button data-testid=\"button-random-seed\" ...>Randomize</button>`) that clears the seed input and generates a new seed.\n3. Update the start button text from \"ENTER RIDE\" to \"ENTER MAZE\" to match the test expectations.\n4. Ensure the new elements have the correct styling and are integrated into the existing layout.\n\nPlease review the proposed modifications to [MainMenu.tsx](cci:7://file:///Users/jbogaty/src/arcade-cabinet/Beppo-Laughs/client/src/components/game/MainMenu.tsx:0:0-0:0). Once approved, I will apply the changes and re‑run the e2e suite.",
