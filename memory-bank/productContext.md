# Product Context

## Why Beppo Laughs exists
Beppo Laughs aims to provide a unique horror experience that combines the whimsical (but creepy) nature of a vintage circus with modern procedural generation and AI-driven asset creation. It's built for fans of surreal horror and those who enjoy "escape room" style challenges in a 3D environment.

## Problems it solves
- Repetitive horror gameplay: Procedural mazes ensure every run can be different.
- High asset costs: Using AI at build-time allows for a rich, varied visual style without needing a massive art team.
- Barrier to sharing: 3-word seeds make it easy for players to share specific terrifying experiences with friends.

## How it should work
- Players enter a 3-word seed (or get a random one).
- A 3D maze is extruded from a 2D generated grid.
- Players drive a "clown car" HUD through the maze on a fixed rail.
- Enemies (paper-mache cutouts) pop up/drop down to block paths.
- Players must find specific items (scissors, lamps) to "resolve" enemies and continue.
- Sanity meters track Fear and Despair, affecting the visual distortions.

## User Experience Goals
- Surreal Dread: The "Monty Python" style cutouts should feel uncanny and disturbing.
- Retro/Low-fi Vibes: Emphasize "paper-mache" and collage textures.
- Accessibility: Rail-based movement simplifies controls while maintaining immersion.
- Community: Seed sharing should be a core part of the social experience.
